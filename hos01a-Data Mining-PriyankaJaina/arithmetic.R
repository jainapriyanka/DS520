# Variables and Assignment

# Cost of a car in USD
car_price_in_USD <- 10000
# Exchange rate
yen_per_dollar <- 109.90
# Cost of a car in JPY
car_price_in_JPY <- car_price_in_USD * yen_per_dollar

# Now, we can print out the value of the variable in two ways
# 1) Call print on it
print(car_price_in_JPY)
# 2) Just put it on its own line (under the hood, this calls print for you)
car_price_in_JPY
